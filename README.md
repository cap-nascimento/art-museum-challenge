### Art Museum Challenge

- This is a web development challenge. Basically, you'll build a complete system to retrieve and show data about art.
- By 'art' I mean paintings, sculptures photos and all sorts of things that you can do with the API you choose.

##### Constraints

- You must use ReactJS (or React Native) on frontend.
- You'll need a API to do requests.

##### Development

- Before the code, make sure to do some prototype for your website or app. I highly suggest figma.
- Start your project from this repository. You can clone or fork it.

##### More info

- If this README.md is not clear enough, let me know.
